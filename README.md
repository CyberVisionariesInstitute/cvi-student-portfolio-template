# CVI PKI Career Pathway — Student Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on learning and professional development through the **CyberVisionaries Institute (CVI) PKI Career Pathway Cohort**.

## Repository Structure
- `labs/` — weekly lab documentation and outputs
- `notes/` — weekly key concepts in my own words
- `reflections/` — weekly reflection prompts
- `projects/` — mini-projects and capstones (as assigned)
- `assets/` — screenshots, diagrams, supporting images

## How I Work
Each week, I:
1. Review the week’s lesson notes and lab instructions (from CVI)
2. Complete the lab
3. Document results in `labs/`
4. Summarize key concepts in `notes/`
5. Submit reflections in `reflections/`
6. Commit with clear messages

## About CVI
CyberVisionaries Institute builds sustainable, demonstrable technical capability in cybersecurity through structured training and mentorship.
