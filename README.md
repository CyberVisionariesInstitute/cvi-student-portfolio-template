# CVI PKI Career Pathway — Student Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on learning and professional development through the **CyberVisionaries Institute (CVI) PKI Career Pathway Cohort**.

This is my working portfolio — not the curriculum repository.

All instructional materials live in the CVI curriculum repo.
All work artifacts live here.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as:
1. A structured lab documentation workspace
2. A technical reflection journal
3. A growing PKI portfolio
4. Evidence of hands-on capability

Everything committed here should reflect professional standards.

## Repository Structure
- `labs/` — weekly lab documentation and outputs
- `notes/` — weekly key concepts in my own words
- `reflections/` — weekly reflection responses
- `projects/` — mini-projects and capstones (as assigned)
- `assets/` — screenshots, diagrams, supporting images

Each folder has a specific purpose.
Do not mix content types across directories.

## Weekly Workflow
Each week follows this structure:
1. Review lesson notes and lab instructions from the CVI curriculum repository
2. Complete the lab exercises
3. Document results in `labs/`
4. Summarize key concepts in `notes/`
5. Submit reflections in `reflections/`
6. Commit changes with a clear, professional message

## Document Standards

All entries should demonstrate:
1. Clear technical reasoning
2. Structured thinking
3. Concise explanations
4. Professional tone

Avoid:
- Vague summaries
- Copying definitions without understanding
- Single-word commit messages

This repository represents your technical growth.

## About CVI
