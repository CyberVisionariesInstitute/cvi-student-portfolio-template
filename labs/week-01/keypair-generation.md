# Week 01 Lab — Key Pair Generation

## Screenshot Evidence

If using OpenSSL:
1. Capture a screenshot showing:
  - The command used to generate the private key
  - The command used to extract the public key
2. Save it as:

**assets/screenshots/week-01/keypair-generation.png**

3. Embed the screenshot below:

**![Key Pair Generation](../../assets/screenshots/week-01/keypair-generation.png)**

If using a browser-based generator, capture the generated key pair screen (redact sensitive portions of the private key before committing).

## Key Identification
**Which file is the public key?**
<!-- Example: public.key -->

**Which file is the private key?**
<!-- Example: private.key -->

---

## Key Properties
Briefly describe:
- What makes the public key safe to share
- What makes the private key sensitive

---

## Security Scenario
What would happen if someone obtained your private key?

Explain the risk in terms of:
  - Identity
  - Impersonation
  - Trust

---

## Observations
Document three observations from this lab.

**Observation 1**
<!-- What did you notice about key generation? -->

**Observation 2**
<!-- What did you notice about key size or format? -->

**Observation 3**
<!-- What did you notice about how the keys differ? -->

---

## Reflection
In 3–5 sentences, explain:

Why must the private key remain secret in a PKI system?

Focus on how identity is tied to possession of the private key.
