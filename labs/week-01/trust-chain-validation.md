## Website Information

**Website inspected:**

## Certificate Chain Breakdown

**Leaf (Server) Certificate**  
<!-- Enter Common Name or Subject -->

**Intermediate Certificate Authority**
<!-- Enter Intermediate CA name -->

**Root Certificate Authority (Trust Anchor)**
<!-- Enter Root CA name -->

---

## Trust Anchor Verification

Is the Root CA marked as trusted by your system?

<!-- Yes / No -->

If yes, explain where that trust comes from (OS/browser root store).

If no, explain what warning or behavior occurred.

---

## Observations

Document three observations about the certificate.

### Observation 1
<!-- What did you notice about the chain structure? -->

### Observation 2
<!-- What did you notice about the Root CA? -->

### Observation 3
<!-- What did you notice about how the browser determines trust? -->

---

## Reflection

In 3–5 sentences, explain:
- Why the Root certificate is called a trust anchor
- How validation walks the certificate chain
- What would happen if the Root CA were not trusted

Use your own words.
